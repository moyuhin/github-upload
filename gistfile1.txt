It is recommended that every repository include a README, LICENSE, and .gitignore. 

# create a new repository on the command line
* echo "# Angular-First-Project" >> README.md
* git init
* git add README.md
* git commit -m "first commit"
* git remote add origin https://github.com/akshaymittal143/Angular-First-Project.git
* git push -u origin master
